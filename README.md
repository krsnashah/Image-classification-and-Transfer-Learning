Here I have compared performances of Xception, MobileNet and ResNet50 architechtures in image classification problem for 5 classes of flowers. 

I used transfer learning where  the weights from these pre-trained models were used and the training was done with my dataset only for the last layers of the models. 

This task was done as a part of an Advanced Machine Learning course at University of New Orleans.
